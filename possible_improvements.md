# Ideas to Improve the Legal Document Analysis Project

-  Use advanced embedding models like OpenAI's to better understand the meaning of text.
-  Fine-tune a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) specifically on legal documents to generate more accurate answers.
-  Improve keyword and article matching algorithms.
-  Create a batch processing system to generate embeddings for large sets of documents.
-  Add serialization for vector stores and generated summaries.
-  Enhance the text cleaning process to handle more complex formatting issues.
-  Use dimension reduction methods like UMAP and explore other ways to optimize embeddings.
-  Design a user-friendly interface for easier system interaction.
-  Build a system to identify and link citations within documents.
-  Develop thorough unit and integration tests.
- Implement and compare different vectorization techniques (TF-IDF, BERT) alongside the current method.
- The Generator class could benefit from more sophisticated prompt engineering techniques.
- Use a knowledge graph-based approach like neo4js
